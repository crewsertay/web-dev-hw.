# Assignment-3 Readme

- A page can have multiple head and body elements to help define and structure the page.
- The structural markup helps to visually organize a page using elements like headings, paragraphs and lists. The semantic markup of a page helps the author put emphasis on certain words or important phrases on the page.

## Work Cycle

For this project I began to realize just how tedious coding can be. Once again I worked step by step on my assignment, keeping the class website open next to atom at all times. I am still have some trouble with getting links to work correctly on the first try as I am inputing the code incorrectly at first. I want to know more about the differences between elements like <b>del</b> and <b>strikethrough</b> and why we need to distinguish between them while writing our code. I didn't post any problems to the repo and want to be better about checking it before I start an assignment to anticpate potential problems, rather than at the end of the assignment.
