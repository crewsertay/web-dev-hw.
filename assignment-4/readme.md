# Assignment-4 Readme

- We use alt text so that users who are visually impaired can still access our sites and get the same experience as readers who can see images.

- The most common form I have seen on the web is while filling out payment information on a site.

## Work Cycle

During this cycle I did what I usually try to do which is work on my coding with the instructions and the class webpage side by side.

One problem that I had this week was getting my table formatted correctly. I am a very visual learner, so reading instructions about how to format a table wasn't really helpful for me, and I had to play around with it for quite a while before I figured out how to format it correctly.

I am curious about "back end" of the form process; how to access the info that users submit, etc.

I didn't help any classmates via the repo this week, but I did help one of my friends who is also in the class in person because she was struggling with her table as well.
