    <pre>
      I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
      I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
      But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
      'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind

      I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
      I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
      And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

      But here I am
      Next to you
      The sky is more blue
      In Malibu
      Next to you
      In Malibu
      Next to you

      We watched the sun go down as we were walking
      I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
      You would explain the current, as I just smile
      Hoping I just stay the same and nothing will change
      And it'll be us, just for a while
      Do we even exist?
      That's when I make the wish
      To swim away with the fish

      Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
      I never would've believed you
      If three years ago you told me
      I'd be here writing this song

      But here I am
      Next to you
      The sky is so blue
      In Malibu
      Next to you
      In Malibu
      Next to you

      Next to you
      The sky is so blue
      In Malibu
      Next to you

      We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
      Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
      And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
      It's a brand new start
      A dream come true
      In Malibu
