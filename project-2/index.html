          Instructions
        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Melt the butter and set aside to cool down slightly.</li>
          <li>To a mixing bowl, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Use a whisk to combine all dry ingredients well.</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, combine buttermilk, vanilla, and egg. Whisk to combine. Add melted butter and whisk again.</li>
          <li>Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking and stirring to mix it all together. Once it's combined, stop mixing. If you over-mix, your pancakes won't be light and fluffy.</li>
          <li>Set pancake batter aside and heat up a large skillet or griddle over MED-LOW heat. Add a bit of butter to the preheated griddle and spread it out.</li>
          <li>Use a 1/4 or 1/3 cup measuring cup to scoop the pancake batter onto the griddle or skillet. Slowly pour it onto the surface, circling outwards to make a nice circle.</li>
          <li>Let the pancake cook about 2-3 minutes. You'll notice bubbles popping up on the surface of the pancake, if the edges look set, carefully flip the pancake over. Cook another 2 minutes on the other side.</li>
          <li>Remove to a plate and cover with a kitchen towel. Alternatively, you can place the pancakes on a baking sheet and keep it in a low heat oven (175-200 degrees), until you're ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>

          Additional information
        </h2>
        You may need to add more buttermilk depending on the consistency of your batter. The batter should be runny enough to spoon onto the skillet or griddle. These pancakes are best enjoyed with butter and syrup, enjoy!
